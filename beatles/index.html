				For the 50th anniversary of The Beatles’s Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band 
				album, the city of Liverpool has commissioned 13 new works, including public art,
				concerts, theatre and dance performances — each inspired by a song from the album.
				Among the pieces unveiled in the city on Thursday, 1 June are a 12-metre-high 
				psychedelic mural by the US artist Judy Chicago, a series of public billboards
				by the British artist Jeremy Deller.

					Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
				</h1>
				<p>
					"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band" is the eighth studio album by  
					English rock band the Beatles. Released on 26 May 1967 in the United Kingdom   
					and 2 June 1967 in the United States, it was an immediate commercial and  
					critical success, spending 27 weeks at the top of the UK albums chart  
					and 15 weeks at number one in the US.

				Chicago says that although she was never a particularly big Beatles fan —  
				<q>I’m not the groupie type. I was in my studio</q> — they represented  
				<q>hope and change</q> to her. She was assigned the song Fixing a Hole  
				as the starting point for her commission and after researching the various  
				theories of the song’s meaning, from drug use to a hole in Paul McCartney’s  
				new roof, she alighted on the idea of <q>fixing a hole in history — who gets  
				to participate in it</q>. As an artist who has fought over much of her career  
				to highlight the role of women in art history, Chicago says she <q>related to that</q>.

				The mural, titled <!-- title of a work --> Four Lads from Liverpool (2017), was still being completed  
				today on the side of an old grain silo at the edge of one of the city’s former docks.   
				Standing outside the hotel she is staying at across the water and using a  
				telephoto lens, Chicago gave instructions to Gary Jones, a former sign painter,   
				via mobile telephone: <q>The shading on the head of Ringo looks really good!</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				Chicago says that people have been surprised she didn’t have a team of workers  
				make the mural but she counters that by collaborating with one person—and naming  
				him in the press material — <q>it emphasises, in an era of big studios of nameless 
				assistants, the individual’s voice</q>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Meanwhile, Jeremy Deller has produced a series of signs and billboards in  
				prominent locations around Liverpool declaring: Brian Epstein died for you.  
				<q>Our debt to him is huge</q>, Deller says of Epstein, who discovered  
				The Beatles and became their manager, as well as a close friend. <q>I grew up  
				with the band, and I’m mildly obsessed with [Epstein]</q>, Deller adds.

			<p>
				The public works come on the back of the Deller’s recent Strong and Stable My Arse  
	 			fly-posters that sprung up around London last month, mocking the British  
	 			Prime Minister Theresa May’s campaign slogan. Deller says he plans to use  
	 			the medium again in the future as it is <q>very effective—its good [for people]  
	 			to see something real</q>, as opposed to online.
			</p>
			<p>
				The song assigned to Deller was "With a Little Help from My Friends", and  
				a further performance piece inspired by it, will take place on Friday.  
				The work is a closely guarded secret, with Deller only revealing that  
				there will be <q>things happening in the city</q>.
